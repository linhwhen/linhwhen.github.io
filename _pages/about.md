Hi! I am a localization product manager based in Brooklyn, NY. Previously, I studied computer science at The University of Texas at Austin.

My research interests include building ethical design systems for marginalized groups.

I also spend my time climbing, writing, and illustrating.

This website holds my portfolio of creative work as well as a blog for smaller projects, research, and essays.
